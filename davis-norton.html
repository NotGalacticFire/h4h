          <p>Hello, I'm Davis Norton, a rising senior at Ridge High School and the secretary for Hearts for Healing. I joined Hearts for Healing because I wanted the ability to better my community and those who help made and make it what it is.</p>
          <p>Throughout my live I have always hoped everyone felt that they are appreciated no matter where they are in life, especially in places like veterans hospitals. This organization is how I believe that I can best best solve that problem while leaving an impact now and in the future in my current community and beyond.</p>
          <p>Besides assisting with Hearts for Healing, I also enjoy hiking, skiing, traveling, photography, and aviation.</p>

        <p class="role">Saudi Arabia Chapter Event Coordinator</p>
        <div class="profile-bio">
          <p>My name is Nora Radi, and I am currently majoring in Health Management at Batterjee Medical  College. I have actively participated in and organized numerous events led by the Social  Responsibility Unit at BMC, including the Iftar Saeem Initiative, Writing Day, and the Food Security  Initiative. These experiences have deepened my commitment to community engagement and  fostered a strong sense of teamwork and leadership.</p>
          <p>I am passionate about social responsibility, and when I set a goal, I do everything I can to achieve it. I am very goal-oriented, always prioritizing my education while giving necessary attention to extracurricular activities.</p>
          <p>My experience working during the Hajj season for three years has taught  me how to handle pressure effectively and adapt to challenging situations. Each year has  transformed me, enhancing my communication skills and helping me stand out in a crowd. With a  blend of academic dedication and hands-on experience, I am excited about the future and the  opportunities that lie ahead! I look forward to continuing my journey and making a meaningful  impact.

        <p class="role">Saudi Arabia Chapter Vice Head of Events</p>
        <div class="profile-bio">
          <p>I'm Ammarah Tayyebah, a 3rd-year medical student at Batterjee Medical College, with a strong passion for healthcare, community service, and leadership. With over 87 volunteer hours across platforms like the Saudi Red Crescent Authority, Jeddah Municipality, Heart Friends Charitable Society, the National Center for the Non-Profit Sector, and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development (KSA), I value every opportunity to serve and give back.</p>
          <p>At BMC, I've helped lead and organize major events, including the Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign, Violence Against Women Awareness Event, Annual Book Exchange, BMC Writing Day, Saudi National Day Celebration, and the Annual School Forum. These experiences have strengthened my organizational and teamwork skills, and deepened my connection to the community.</p>
          <p>As Vice Head of Events at Hearts for Healing, I'm excited to support patient-centered programs that bring emotional healing and hope to those in need. I'm fluent in English, Urdu, Hindi, Punjabi, and have basic proficiency in Korean, which helps me connect with diverse communities and expand the reach of every initiative I take part in.</p>

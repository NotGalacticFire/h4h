        <p class="role">Scarsdale, New York Chapter Co-President</p>
        <div class="profile-bio">
          <p>My name is Max, and I’m a student currently attending Scarsdale High School in New York. I am happy and hopeful about making a clear impact in my community, whether it be through organizing drives for hospitals or supporting local causes like hospitals, animal shelters, and homeless shelters.</p>
          <p>Outside of volunteering and school, I swim for varsity and train year-round. I also enjoy the gym, reading, and photography as my hobbies. Through experiences like these, I’ve been taught how to balance demanding schedules and deal with setbacks. I’m excited to offer my leadership and devoted service to help lead alongside the New York chapter of this organization and continue helping others to expand its mission through meaningful measures.</p>
